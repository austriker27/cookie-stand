# Seattle's Finest Salmon Cookies by Pat

This project built a website for Pat who sells delicious salmon cookies in Seattle (slash Code Fellows 201). The intent as to build customer facing pages for the business and a sales page that generates sales numbers for the locations of Pat's stores based on sales numbers supplied by Pat. Also Pat is an enterprising young entrepreneur so he may open up future stores. As such we added the ability to add stores the sales page.
